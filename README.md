# 🔮 Fortune Teller App (Desktop Edition)

Welcome to my very first Java project — a desktop-based **Fortune Teller App** built in NetBeans!  
This simple console app delivers randomly generated motivational or funny messages when you run it. ✨


## 💡 What It Does

- Prints a random fortune to the console
- Lets the user choose if they want another one
- Loops until the user says "no"
- 100% sass and smiles guaranteed


## 🧪 How to Run It

> Make sure you have Java (JDK) and NetBeans installed.

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open it in NetBeans
3. Run the `FortuneTeller.java` file from the `src/` directory
4. Follow the prompts in the console


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Java (Console)
- NetBeans IDE
- Big dreams and caffeine


## 📌 Future Plans

- Build a GUI version using **JavaFX**
- Add more fortunes and categories
- Save user fortune history (because who doesn’t want to reflect on their weird vibes?)
- Hopefully I can get it up and running using javafx
